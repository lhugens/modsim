\begin_layout Title
Molecular Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Leonardo Hügens and Johanna Lömker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molecular Dynamics simulations consist in numerically integrating the equations
 of motion of a system, starting from an initial configuration, and measuring
 time averages of quantities of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Initial Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our system consists of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 particles in a cubic box 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,L\right]^{3}$
\end_inset

, which gives a particle density of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\frac{N}{L^{3}}$
\end_inset

.
 The initial positions where chosen at random with uniform probability inside
 the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For initial velocities, we first generate every velocity component randomly
 with uniform distribution in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 We then calculate the total momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P}$
\end_inset

, and shift all the velocities equally such that the new total momentum
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we rescale every velocity component by the same constant such that
 the total kinetic energy matches the desired temperature at which we want
 to perform our simulation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{kin}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{mv_{i}^{2}}{2}=\frac{3Nk_{B}T}{2}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Particle Interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the Lennard-Jones potential energy between every pair of particles,
 given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u\left(r_{ij}\right)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r_{ij}}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r_{ij}}\right)^{6}\right]-e_{\mathrm{cut}} & r_{ij}\leq r_{\mathrm{cut}}\\
0 & r_{ij}>r_{\mathrm{cut}}
\end{array}\right.,
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{\mathrm{cut}}=4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r_{\mathrm{cut}}}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r_{\mathrm{cut}}}\right)^{6}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\mathrm{cut}}$
\end_inset

 is the maximum distance two particles can have from each other to still
 be affected by each other's potential.
 In our simulations, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\text{cut}}=\frac{L}{3}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain the force, we determine the gradient of this potential, which
 gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{f}_{ij}=-\nabla u=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
-48\frac{\boldsymbol{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{8}}\left(\frac{1}{r_{ij}^{6}}-\frac{1}{2}\right) & r_{ij}\leq r_{\mathrm{cut}}\\
0 & r_{ij}>r_{\mathrm{cut}}
\end{array}\right.,
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Integration Scheme
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integration scheme we used in this assignment is the 
\emph on
Velocity Verlet
\emph default
 algorithm, whose recursive process for each particle goes as follows, given
 it's position 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{v}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and force acting on it 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{f}(t)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{r}(t+dt) & =\boldsymbol{r}\left(t\right)+\boldsymbol{v}\left(t\right)dt+\frac{\boldsymbol{f}(t)}{2m}dt^{2}\\
\boldsymbol{v}\left(t+dt\right) & =\boldsymbol{v}\left(t\right)+\frac{1}{2m}\left(\boldsymbol{f}(t)+\boldsymbol{f}(t+dt)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also apply periodic boundary conditions, not only implicitly in the calculati
on of the force but also explicitly in the position updates (apply them
 when a particles falls outside the box), such that all positions are always
 inside the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
NVE and NVT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the NVE ensemble, we just run the simulation as described above, storing
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{kin}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{potential}$
\end_inset

 at every time step.
 For the NVT ensemble, we define a frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, and at every time step select each particle with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\,dt$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

undergo a collision with a heat bath at temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

, which in practice means setting its component's values to randomly generated
 ones according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(v_{i}\right)=\sqrt{\frac{m}{2}\frac{\beta}{\pi}}e^{-\frac{m}{2}\beta v_{i}^{2}},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which is a gaussian distribution with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0$
\end_inset

 and standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\frac{1}{\beta m}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, right after we perform the a verlet step, we generate
 a random number in 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 with uniform probability, and if it less than the Andersen probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\,dt$
\end_inset

 we update that particles velocity components, each with a random value
 according to 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(v_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Autocorrelation and Diffusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The velocity autocorrelation function for a given time difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is evaluated, for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 particles, and a run of length 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi\left(\Delta t\right)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{T-\Delta t}\sum_{t=1}^{T-\Delta t}\boldsymbol{v}_{i}\left(t\right).\boldsymbol{v}_{i}\left(t+\Delta t\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With it, the diffusion coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is given by the Green-Kubo relation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the system's dimensionality (3 in our case):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D=\frac{1}{d}\int_{0}^{\infty}dt\,\chi\left(t\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
NVE ensemble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our first NVE simulations, we we're using 
\begin_inset Formula $L=5$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $L=10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=100$
\end_inset

, which created some divergences in 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{kin}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{pot}$
\end_inset

.
 Of course this was due to the average distance between particles in this
 configuration being too small, being easy for two particles to be too close
 (and thus have a huge potential energy) either right at the start of the
 simulation, when positions are generated randomly, or at any other instant
 of the simulation.
 Thus, we thought the most sensible thing to do was to use a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and low density, to minimize the possibility of two particles being generated
 too close to each other at the start.
 We also used a not very high temperature, such that initial velocities
 are not too high, which prevents particles from colliding so fast that
 would make our time step of 
\begin_inset Formula $dt=0.001$
\end_inset

 too high.
 Thus, we changed to 
\begin_inset Formula $L=25$
\end_inset

, which gives density of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.0064$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Let's analyze the plots above.
 Firstly, we have a visual confirmation that the way we initialized the
 velocities is correct, because the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{kin}}$
\end_inset

 initial value should be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{2}\frac{N}{\beta}$
\end_inset

, which is 75 for the values we used for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, and that is exactly the starting value that we see in the plot.
 Secondly, we can see roughly see that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{kin}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{pot}$
\end_inset

 have opposed behaviors, which is to expect from the NVE ensemble, because
 it's what we'd expect from a constant total energy.
 This is confirmed by the plot below, where we see that the total energy
 has a very low fluctuation in percentage around a value which is 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx70.93$
\end_inset

.
 We can also see that the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{pot}$
\end_inset

 are negative.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=100$
\end_inset

, this implies not all particles are separated from each other by a distance
 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

sweet spot
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 range where the potential energy has a minimum, but most of them are, which
 makes sense since the initial velocities are low enough for the particles
 to converge to those spots instead of heading onto each other quickly and
 bouncing back outside that range.

For the NVT ensemble, we first wanted to check if the thermostat was working
 correctly, so firstly we generated a lot of samples with the Maxwell Boltzmann
 distribution we intended to use in the simulations and plotted a normalized
 histogram of the samples, which came out as desired, represented in the

 particles where chosen by the thermostat to change their velocity to a

We can observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{kin}}$
\end_inset

 oscillates around the value 
\begin_inset Formula $75$
\end_inset

, which makes sense since that is the value we determined for the initial
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{kin}}$
\end_inset

, according to 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{kin}=\frac{3Nk_{B}T}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{kin}}$
\end_inset

 only differs from the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 by a factor which is constant along the simulation, we can thus verify
 with confidence that the thermostat is working, i.e.
 is keeping the temperature roughly constant around the desired value.
 With the thermostat on, energy is not conserved, which means there is not
 direct observation we can make that relates our 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{kin}}$
\end_inset

 curve with our 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{pot}}$
\end_inset

 curve.
 Because of this lack of evident correlation, we don't think there is anything
 important to say about our total energy curve, represented below.

\begin_layout Standard
An important feature of the correlation function is that when two consecutive
 system configurations are highly correlated, as we had in the Ising single
 flip procedure, and as we have here, because the verlet procedure is completely
 deterministic and two consecutive system configurations are very similar.
 In those cases, as it is mentioned in the Ising notes, an autocorrelation
 function goes approximately as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-t/\tau}$
\end_inset

, and we think the first part of our plot, roughly until 
\begin_inset Formula $t=60000$
\end_inset

, highly resembles that curve, as we can see in the left curve.
 We find it a bit odd that that first part is compatible with what we expected,
 by the previous argument, and then the autocorrelation shows negative values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, we can argue that as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 approaches the total simulation time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, the sum used to determine the correlation function starts having less
 and less terms (e.g.
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=T$
\end_inset

, only value per particle is used), and thus the values around that final
 range start having less and less statistical significance.
 However, we also think it could be related to the average time a particle
 needs for it to have enough close encounters with other particles such
 that it reverts the direction of it's velocity vector, which would produce
 negative terms in the correlation calculation.

When the Andersen thermostat is switched on, when a certain particle is
 chosen to undergo a collision with the heat bath, it's velocity becomes
 completely uncorrelated with it's previous velocities, as its component
 values are changed to randomly generated ones.
 In our simulation, approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $5$

 out of the

 particles undergo this collision per time step, so in average 
\begin_inset Formula $20$

 lost correlation with it's previous velocities, which is very little in
 the scale of the entire simulation.
